    <h1>Lowcharts</h1>
    <p>Lowcharts is a lightweight charting library.</p>
    <p>It provides a simple API for creating charts, and is powered by gnuplot.</p>
    <p>Lowcharts strives for API compatibility with Highcharts (i.e. you could use Highcharts as a drop-in replacement for Lowcharts),
        but Lowcharts only implmenets a small subset of Highcharts' features.</p>
    <script type="module">
        import * as lowcharts from './index.js';

        console.log(lowcharts);
